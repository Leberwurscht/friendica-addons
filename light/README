Light protocol
==============

This addon adds a very simple protocol to your Friendica installation which can be used to communicate with
people that do not have an account in the federated social network.
To achieve this, it implements a simple HTTP API. No connections are opened by Friendica. This means the other
side needs to poll the stream.
POST or GET may be used, but POST should be used for the security token.

API v0.1:

/light/v0.1/intro?target=...&url=...&name=...&avatar=...&body=... [returns token]
 -> introduce to a Friendica user and request a token to communicate with him
 - 'target' is the nickname of the Friendica user
 - 'url' is the URL of the requester, e.g. his homepage
 - 'name' is the nickname of the requester
 - 'avatar' is the avatar URL of the requester
 - 'body' is some notice that should be added to the introduction

/light/v0.1/stream [POST token=...]
 -> display the items the Friendica user shares with you, as atom feed
 - only available if the Friendica user accepted your introduction

/light/v0.1/post?title=...&body=...&in_reply_to=... [POST token=...]
 -> posts to the Friendica user
 - 'title' is the title of the post
 - 'body' is the content of the post
 - 'in_reply_to' may be empty or the URI of a parent post (for comments)
 - only available if the Friendica user accepted your introduction

/light/v0.1/like?in_reply_to=... [POST token=...]
 -> to like a post of a Friendica user
 - 'in_reply_to' must be the URI of a parent post
 - only available if the Friendica user accepted your introduction
