Light protocol
==============

This addon adds a very simple protocol to your Friendica installation that can be used to communicate with
people that do not have some account in the federated social network.
No connections are opened by Friendica. The other side needs to poll the stream.

API:

/light/intro?target=...&url=...&name=...&avatar=...&body=... [returns token]
 - introduce to a Friendica user and request a token to communicate with him
 - 'target' is the nickname of the Friendica user
 - 'url' is the URL of the requester, e.g. his homepage
 - 'name' is the nickname of the requester
 - 'avatar' is the avatar URL of the requester
 - 'body' is some notice that should be added to the introduction

/light/stream [POST token=...]
 - display the items the Friendica user shares with you, as atom feed
 - only available if the Friendica user accepted your introduction

/light/post?title=...&body=...&in_reply_to=... [POST token=...]
 - posts to the Friendica user
 - 'title' is the title of the post
 - 'body' is the content of the post
 - 'in_reply_to' may be empty or the URI of a parent post (for comments)

/light/like?in_reply_to=... [POST token=...]
 - to like a post of a Friendica user
 - 'in_reply_to' must be the URI of a parent post

TODO:
 - /light/message for private messages
 - user setting to activate/deactivate
