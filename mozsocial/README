Mozilla Social API for Friendica
================================

Experimental addon that provides a basic Social API for Firefox.

Note: There is no multi-provider support at least up to Firefox 17,
so only Facebook can be used with the Social API unless you alter
some about:config entries. Alternatively, you can use the Firefox addon
 socialapi-hack.xpi (https://github.com/Leberwurscht/socialapi-hack)
which does this for you.

You need to delete social.manifest.facebook, set social.active and
social.enabled to true and add an entry social.manifest.friendica with
this value (adapt URLs!):
 {"origin":"http://friendica.yoursite.com","name":"Friendica Messenger",
  "workerURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/worker.js",
  "iconURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/icon.png",
  "sidebarURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/sidebar.html"}
After that, a restart of Firefox is necessary.
