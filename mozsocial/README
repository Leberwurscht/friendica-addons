Mozilla Social API for Friendica
================================

about:config entry:

Name: social.manifest.friendica
Value: {"origin":"http://friendica.yoursite.com","name":"Friendica Messenger","workerURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/worker.js","iconURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/icon.png","sidebarURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/sidebar.html"}

TODO:
- Firefox extension that adds the about:config entry
- Friendica seems to get confused when you click log out while the worker is doing its work - suddenly you are logged in again
- sharing/unsharing
- better contentPanels for ambient-notification icons
- when browser is closed, session is also closed
