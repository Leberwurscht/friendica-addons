Mozilla Social API for Friendica
================================

about:config entry:

Name: social.manifest.friendica
Value: {"origin":"http://friendica.yoursite.com","name":"Friendica Messenger","workerURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/worker.js","iconURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/icon.png","sidebarURL":"http://friendica.yoursite.com/addon/mozsocial/sidebar.html"}

TODO:
- in sidebar, special characters in usernames are displayed htmlencoded
- persistent login PARTIALLY DONE
	- remove login cookie on logout DONE
	- prohibit password changing and admin functionality if session is started with login cookie (should be possible by redirect+killme in a settings_post hook)
	- function to delete all remembered sessions DONE
	- only try login cookie if we have one, otherwise we get login failed messages over and over. WORKAROUND
- activation link tag DONE
- Firefox extension that adds the about:config entry? - note: multi-provider support won't come before Firefox 18
- Friendica seems to get confused when you click log out while the worker is doing its work - suddenly you are logged in again
- sharing/unsharing
- better contentPanels for ambient-notification icons
